Architectural details like these staircases show the imagination and aesthetic of craftsmen in designing something utterly practical.

I enjoy architecture that shows creativity. The Versailles palace is an example of its time. I tend to picture buildings of our time, with a preference for horizontality to verticality, and simplicity to convolution. I also like surprising structures.

Some structures are appealing because of their bold ambition.

Interior architecture can mix simplicity of lines with the complexity of what it tends to hide. But the aesthetic sometimes promotes dust collection!

And like anyone else, I also capture older buildings to be able to communicate to others what I have seen.
