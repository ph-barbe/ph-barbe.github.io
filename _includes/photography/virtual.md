## Effects

I like to experiment with things, and repurpose them.

The camera on my phone has a landscape function. The software tracks components of the image and glue them together as one rotates the camera. This allows for 360 degree (or less) pictures.

But that can be repurposed... tricked to track the wrong thing and distort reality.  If you fight against the software by moving the camera in a way that the sky is seemingly the only thing that can be tracked, then your world collapses with that of the software designer, creating a collision of two planets! What does it say on us that we still recognize the blue of the sky?
