## Objects

Objects are all around us. Decorative arts are an endless source of wonder that brightens everyday life. I find very moving that humans have this desire for aesthetic in objects that we use every day. This aesthetic search makes every day objects exceptional, changing their function from being used every day to being used in special occasions. Beyond captureing their beauty, picturing them is a way to express my admiration for those who design them.

Some old objects show that this search for aesthetic is ingrained in us. It is also sometimes stunning how simple tools in the hand of trained craftsmen allow to create perfect objects, everywhere in the world.

Tables and desks, because of their size, cannot get the special occasion function of smaller pieces.

 Chairs may be the most difficult pieces to design, for they need to be comfortable and not create back problems. Some are designed for homes, and some are designed for public spaces; the difference may be only through the material used, but it can also be through the shape. The curved sofa is interesting because it starts with a simple yet clever pattern, and turns it to create a volume. I truely admire designers who come up with these clever ideas.

Some artists with amazing imagination create new objects, not painting, not sculpture, hard to define, but so beautiful, transforming what would be an ordinary place into an exhibition gallery, able to use the most modern and unatural materials to allude to the most ancient and natural themes.
