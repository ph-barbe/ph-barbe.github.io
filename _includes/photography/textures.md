In its ownm way, mathematics is a study of a conceptual formulations of nature. Mathematical objects are every day objects, abstracted.

Partial differential equations govern fluid dynamics, modeling the patterns seen in these two pictures.

Elementary and differential geometries model light patterns.

When winter combines fluid dynamics and geometry, interesting textures result!

Plant growth is a complicated matter. Some differential equations model growth, some stochastic processes model cracking.

Some models of growth may be used to describe moss, random fields may model complex terrains.

Tesselations appear naturally, and various models exists, using partial differential equations, stochastic aggregations and other mathematical objects. Add a simple stone to it, and the physical wonder takes an aesthetic quality. Asking why this stone is there amounts to a vast questionning of the world around us, a perception of its complex beauty, a search for purpose.

Erosion deposit processes have also been modeled.

But nature keeps us wondering...

And when humans give their view of nature, they may take an every day cardbox and create a mysterious forest... making us rethinking what is a real forest.
