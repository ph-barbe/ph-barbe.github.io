## Textures

Mathematics in its own way is a study of nature in a conceptual formulation. Mathematical objects are every day objects, abstracted.

Partial differential equations govern fluid dynamics, creating the patterns seen in these two pictures.

Elementary and differential geometry model light patterns.

When winter combine fluid dynamics and geometry, interesting textures result!

Plant growth is a complicated matter. Some differential equations model growth, some stochastic processes model cracking.

Some model of growth may be used to descript moss, random field may model complex terrain.

Tesselations appear naturally, and various models exists, using partial differential equation, stochastic aggregation and other mathematical objects. Add a simple stone to it, and the physical wonder takes an aesthetic quality. Asking why this stone is there amounts to a vast questionning of the world around us, a perception of its complex beauty, a search for purpose.

Erosion deposite processes have also been model.

But nature keeps us wondering...

And when humans give their view of nature, they may take an every day cardbox and create a mysterious forest... making us rethinking what is a real forest.
