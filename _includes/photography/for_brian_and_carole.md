My friend Brian was born in the United States, knows his country very
well, is well traveled within, but never went outside. His curiosity
is boundless though. Because I
traveled and still travel a fair amount in Europe and Asia, he asked
me to show him what these places look like. I take picture of places
for him. I cannot remember how, but Carol joined Brian in asking
pictures. So I take pictures for Brian and Carol!

| ![image-title-here]({{site.baseurl}}/photography/places/ordinary_places/IMG_5038.JPG){:class="img-responsive" width="100%" style="float"} | I take pictures of undescript places. Often for no other reason that they are undescript and would be otherwise unoticed. It expresses the daily reality of people. But once they are pictured, these places become different for we tend to project an intent. The eye searches something, the mind asks questions. The undescript becomes mysterious: what is this store, what is the smell in this street, who are these people, what are they doing, where are they going, is it their usual way to dress...?|

| A street in Hong Kong. There is no sidewalk along this street. The elevated walkway ensure the safety of pedestrians. One of the challenges of self-driving cars is how to ensure safety as they share infrastructure with pedestrians. Self-driving airplanes, with autopilots, have been around for a long time. So are self-driven metros and trains. The reason is that they have a dedicated infrastructure which reduces the variability of what the software needs to respond to. Parts of Hong Kong seem perfect to make self-driving cars a reality, because they would have a dedicated infrastructure. | ![image-title-here]({{site.baseurl}}/photography/places/ordinary_places/IMG_5062.JPG){:class="img-responsive" width="100%" style="float"} |

If I am in Paris walking, I should send at least one picture that confirms expectations! I also acknowledge that the expectation is right: it is a very nice view on the Seine river and some of the adjacent buildings. |

| Train station in Paris. Where are people going? Interesting mix of an 1900 railroad station architecture designed for steam engine trains, with the modern TGV. What do people wear? What colors are their cloths? How much information is communicated on all the displays in the station, to which everyone seems to add their own information through mobile technology? | ![image-title-here]({{site.baseurl}}/photography/places/ordinary_places/IMG_5839.JPG){:class="img-responsive" width="100%" style="float"} |

The train is comming. On the other platform, one person sits, waiting for another train. The station is empty. Little towns are surviving, fighting for the train to keep operating. |

| I also share with Brian and Carol my interest for architecture, as in this picture of the city hall of Shenzhen in China. I am not trying to take a particularly nice picture that could be featured in a magazine, but just communicate what I see. That picture however fails at rendering the feeling that the size produces. This building is massive, yet amazingly graceful with its comparatively thin undulating roof. |![image-title-here]({{site.baseurl}}/photography/places/ordinary_places/IMG_2720.JPG){:class="img-responsive" width="100%" style="float"} |
