There are plenty of things to picture in Paris. Brian and Carole have seen many street pictures over the years. I thought that I could give them a different feeling for the city by sending them pictures about a single topic, which would force me to look more closely to that topic and see the city differently. One such topic was doors and gates, which are under the same name *porte* in French.

It turns out that doors and gates are amazingly diverse in Paris. But picturing them created interesting questions on their purpose.

This large gate opens one of the university. It is a particularly long structure, that can go down and completely disapear. It has various doors in it, of various sizes. It is a serious barrier, in heavy steal, preventing to enter when needed, opening a wide and welcoming plazza when lowered. Its purpose is clear: prevent entrance. Yet, it fits the need of an academic institution to be open on the outside, for everyone to see inside.

Overall, I found doors of unversities to be really interesting in revealing the ambivalence of the faculty toward restricting access.


|These doors are quite typical of many official buildings. They belong to a high school. The triptych allows for France's motto *Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité* (Liberty, Equality, Fraternity) to be placed at the top of each part, marking the official nature of the building. The triptych also marks the importance of those who enter. The usual entrance is by one of the small doors. If you go by the middle door with a single panel open, you are certainly a noticeable guest. And if both panels are open, then you must be an important person fulfilling an important mission. Doors mark not only the entrance but also the status of those who come in.|![object]({{site.baseurl}}/photography/doors/IMG_7361.JPG){:class="img-responsive imgCentered" width="100%" float="right"}|

Craftsmen took great pride in embelishing doors. Some have a lot of meaning in their embelishments, such as that on the left which belongs to the Sainte Geneviève library: Sainte Geneviève is represented, as well as wreaths symbolizing knowledge

|Usually doors match the facade of the building. By their look, some indicate clearly what sort of building they give access to. They may also have other functions. This door is clearly that of an industrial building, let the light to come in, yet we cannot see inside.|![object]({{site.baseurl}}/photography/doors/IMG_7317.JPG){:class="img-responsive" width="100%" float="right"}|

It is of roman style, but the stone is too regular to be from the 12th century or so. The outside architecture of this church is interesting in the sense that it makes it looking as much as a church as possible.|

|Yet, inside, Notre Dame du Travail reveals it was built in early 20th century and celebrates the workers of the time. While the door and overall exterior architecture indicates clearly the purpose of the building, they give no indication on the architectural style inside.| ![door]({{site.baseurl}}/photography/doors/IMG_7340.JPG){:class="img-responsive" width="100%" float="left"}|

The doors here are a small sample of the many I pictured. I was surprised not only by their diversity, but also by how much there is to say on each of them, their form, function, location, symbolism...
