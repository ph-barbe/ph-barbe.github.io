## Doors in Paris

There is plenty of things to picture in Paris. But Brian and Carole has seen many street pictures over the years. I thought that I could give them a different feeling for the city by sending them picture about a single topic, which would force me to look more closely to that topic and see the city differently. One such topic was doors and gate, which are under the same name *porte* in French.

It turns out that doors and gates are amazingly diverse in Paris. But picturing them created interesting questions on their purpose.

This large gate opens one of the university. It is a particularly long structure, that can go down and completely disapear. It has various doors in it, of various sizes. It is a serious barrier, in heavy steal, preventing to enter when needed, opening a wide and welcoming plazza when lowered. Its purpose is clear: prevent entrance. Yet, it fits the need of an academic institution to be open on the outside, for everyone to see inside.

|These doors are quite typical of many official building. These belong to a high school. The triptych allows for France's motto 'Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité' (Liberty, Equality, Fraternity) at the top of each part to mark the official nature of the building. But is also allow to mark the importance of those who enter. The usual entrance is by one of the small doors. If you go by the middle door with a single panel open, you are certainly a noticeable guest. And if both panels are open, then you must be an important person fulfilling an important mission. Doors mark not only the entrance but also the importance of those who come in.|![object]({{site.baseurl}}/photography/doors/IMG_7361.JPG){:class="img-responsive imgCentered" width="100%" float="right"}|

Craftsmen took great pride in embelishing doors. Some have a lot of meaning in their embelishments, such as that on the left which belongs to the Sainte Geneviève library: Sainte Geneviève is represented, as well as wreath symbolizing knowledge

|Usually doors match the facade of the building. By their look, some indicate clearly what sort of building they give access to. They may also have other functions. This door is clearly that of an industrial building, leave light in, yet one does not see us see inside.|![object]({{site.baseurl}}/photography/doors/IMG_7317.JPG){:class="img-responsive" width="100%" float="right"}|

It is of roman style, but the stone is too regular to be from the 12th century or so. The outside architecture of this church is interesting in the sense that makes it looking as much as a church as possible.|

|Yet, inside Notre Dame du Travail reveals it was built in early 20th century and celebrate the workers of the time. While the door and overall exterior architecture indicates clearly the purpose of the building, they give no indication on the inside.| ![door]({{site.baseurl}}/photography/doors/IMG_7340.JPG){:class="img-responsive" width="100%" float="left"}|

The doors here are a small sample of the many I pictured. I was surprise not only by their diversity, but also by how much there is to say on each of them, their form, function, location, symbolism...
