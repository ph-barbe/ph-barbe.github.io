I am not a serious photographer. Since this is my personal website, this page is less about my photographies, than about why I am taking pictures and what interests me in photography.

I spent some time in the past working on
pictures with a non-digital camera and black and white films. 
When digital came, I had other priorities, and never bought a good
digital camera. When phones became good camera, my interest 
in photography came back, in a different way, and I can see myself 
getting more serious about it in the future. For now, all what I am using is my cell phone, mostly because I do not want to carry more equipment.

The following pictures have been sometimes cropped, but their colors are the original ones. They are intended not as a exhibition, but as a way to tell you why I take pictures.

I take pictures for various reasons, but my pleasure of taking them derive from being able to see a richer world by focusing on some of its details. The poet Francis Ponge wrote *J'Ã©cris pour ajouter au monde quelque chose qui l'augmente* (I write to add to the world something that increases it). This is very much the way I feel about taking picture: it adds to the world that I perceive by forcing me to look at it differently.

While on the face of the picture, this addition may seem about what is pictured, it is sometimes about the people for whom I take these pictures.
