I try to remain educated, meaning reading some books, newspapers, articles and so on. My interests have been changing over the years, depending on where I live, who I hang out with, and geo-political events. Some constants have been international, domestic and military affaires. I also read a fair amount on architecture, design, and sustainability.

Writing is an important part of my life. I wrote and write both scientific papers and general articles.

In my spare time I  played the clarinet and the organ for some years, but piano has been my main instrument. I wrote some music, stopped for several decades, and went back to it in 2020.

My intellectual self is balanced by a life long interest in manual work. I can probably build a house from scratch though I never tried. I also had periods of elaborate cooking, though now I am mostly baking my own bread every day -- French baguettes straight from the oven are irresistible! I owe this bread making interest to our friend Joseph who is an accomplished musician, baker, writer, and photographer.

Throughout my life I have been practicing sports, but I am no superman. I have no interest in watching sports. I went to a school where 6 hours of sport each week was mandatory (3 times 2 hours). It also required students to learn a new sport every semester, under the direction of particularly knowledgeable instructors. I have practiced various ball sports (soccer, rubgy, handball, basketball, water polo, tennis, babmington), running (100m, 500m, relay, hurdling, long distance), throwing (hammer, javelin, disk, weight), jumping (high jump, long jump, pole vault), swiming (crawl, butterfly, breaststroke, diving), gymanstic (horizontal bar, parallel bar, rings, rope climbing), combat sports (fencing, judo, and even shooting, which is rare in France), winter sports (downhill and cross-country skiing, ice skating), sports on wheels (bicycle, roller skating). I was an avid fencer (all weapons) for several years.

This tremendous training gave me an appreciation for all sports, and tons of fun memory! 

I still do some physical activity to keep in shape, and remain an avid downhill skier.

If you want to laugh at my expense: I jumped far lower at the pole vault then at the high jump! The only way I can jump as high is to throw away the pole before jumping!
