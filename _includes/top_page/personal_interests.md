### Personal interests

In my spare time, I currently do a few things: reading, writing, music, some wood working, and I can probably build a house from scratch though I never tried. I also had periods of elaborate cooking, though now I am mostly baking my own bread every day -- French baguettes straight from the oven are irresistible! I owe our friend Joseph (musician, baker, writer) that bread making interest.

I also downhill ski.

My non-professional interests have been changing over the years, depending to where I lived, who I hanged out with, and geo-political events. Some constants have been international, domestic and military affaires. I used to listen a lot of music and play a fair amount of piano. I learned the clarinet for a few years, and played the organ. I also wrote some music, stopped for several decades, and went back to it lately. I was at some point very knowledgeable in Soviet movies because tickets at the Soviet sponsored cinema in Paris were very cheap! 

I also read a fair amount on the following topics: architecture and design (though I am not good at drawing), and sustainability.
