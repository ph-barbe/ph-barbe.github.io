As a business person, I do really one thing: innovation. There two broad categories of innovations in which I specialize:

1. help organizations to define their vision and strategy. As a mathematician, I approach these in a very analytical way, with a lot of rigor, using both inductive and deductive methods, and imagination when it comes to vision (yes, mathematicians, like other scientists have imagination, for it is needed to solve difficult problems).

2. data science, analytic, machine learning, applied math, operation research, whatever math, particularly for very difficult problems that require highly customized solutions. As a loose indication, the problems I tackle range from organizing work and leading teams, to designing complex decision supporting systems, to designing new algorithms, to inventing new conceptual frameworks for solving your problem.

If your problem can be solved with standard methods, I am happy to tell you how to do it, but do not ask me to spend a lot of time on it. I am always seeking difficult problems.
