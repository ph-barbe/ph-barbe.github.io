My avatar is a collage of book covers which tells you a fair amount on myself.

The books are:

- *Strategor*: probably the best book ever written on strategy for business persons. It covers business strategy, corporate strategy, and change management. It is in French and is the standard textbook in top MBA programs.

- *The Elements of Statistical Learning* by J. Friedman, R. Tibshirani, and T. Hastie. This illustrates my original training as well as the change of semantic that I have witnessed. The content of the book used to be part of standard statistics, and got rebranded as machine learning.

- *Shape and Shape Theory* by D. G. Kendall, D. Barden, T. K. Carne, H. Le. Shape theory is one of these fields that any data scientist dealing with image should know, and most ignore. It illustrates my interest in geometric matter, and how I like data science: when it intersects many fields, as here, statistics, differenial geometry, algebraic topology, and computing.

- *Probabilit√©* by myself and M. Ledoux. Writing is an important part of my life, in particular writing books, and so is teaching. Michel Ledoux has influenced many French probabilists. Among many things, he taught me to strive for simplicity.

- *Three Dimensional Geometry and Topology* by W. Thurston. Not only the topic is interesting, but it is the most beautifully typset mathematical book I know. This represents my interests in pure mathematics, as well as the years I studied typography and book composition. It is also attached to David Pollard who made me interested in typesetting and typography, as well as some wonderful time in Blacksburg with Bill Floyd who was involved in the making of this book; and by association, his colleagues in the math department, Marty Day, Peter Haskell, Leslie Kay, John Rossi and others.

- *Deep Learning* by I. Goodfellow, Y. Bengio, A. Courville, is in the same spirit as Friedman, Tibshirani and Hastie's book. It is also my marketing side: I wanted something about the topic of deep learning, and this is one of the few books available on the topic. I encountered neural networks first in 1993. So I have some historical perspective on that matter, and appreciate the field and its evolution.

- *Commentaire* is a journal founded by [Raymond Aron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Aron). The journal is very much a miror of his founder, dominated by realism and pragmatism, with a bend toward liberalism and social democracy. The authors tend to be practionners more than academics. It reflects my interest in the broad range of topics that it covers, albeit from a French perspective.

- *Political Science Quarterly* is about political science, but more broadly, discusses domestic and international affairs, somewhat like *Commentaire*, but more from an american perspective. It is more scholarly than *Commentaire* and this reflects my taste for in depth analyses, as well as my American side.

- Beethoven's sonata because classical music is an important part of my life, both as a listener and as a (very amateur) musician who plays the piano.

This makes it a decent overview of who I am, and tells you more about myself than a picture.
