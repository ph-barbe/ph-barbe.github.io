My professional interests are in business and mathematics, including data science. Currently, I am mostly doing consulting work.

I have a PhD in mathematics from Université Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris 6), a master in Statistics from Université Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris 6), and a degree in economics and government from the École Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Administration Économique in Paris.
