My professional interests are in business and mathematics, including data science. For the past 6 years or so, I have been buildling business decisions supporting systems.

I have a PhD in mathematics and a master in statistics from Université Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris 6), and a degree in economics and government from the École Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Administration Économique (ENSAE) in Paris.
