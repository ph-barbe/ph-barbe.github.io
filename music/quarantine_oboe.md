The rendering of the music through the software is quite
good for binary rythms, but this piece has a a lot of triplets. 
The software does not interpret: it places no accents on the beats
and does not add dynamic. There are MuseScore tricks to fix these problems, but they are time consuming to implements. As a consequence,
the piece Quarantine 2 is rendered very poorly.
