    I am not a serious photographer.
  </p> 
  <p>
    I spent some time in the past working on
    pictures with a non-digital camera and black and white films. 
    When digital came, I had other priorities, and never bought a good
    digital camera. When phones became good camera, my interest 
    in photography came back, in a different way, and I can see myself 
    getting more serious about it in the future.

    I take pictures for various reasons:

    Pictures for friends
  </h2>
      My friend Brian was born in the United States, knows his country very
      well, is well traveled within, but never went outside. His curiosity
      is boundless though. Because I
      traveled and still travel a fair amount in Europe and Asia, he asked
      me to show him what these places look like. I take picture of places
      for him. I cannot remember how, but Carole joined Brian in asking
      picture. So I take pictures for Brian and Carole!
      Ordinary street life, most unoticeable places. But once they
      are pictured, these places become different. The eye searches something,
      the mind askes questions. The undescript becomes mysterious: what is
      this store, what is the smell in this street, who are these people,
      what are they doing?

      the architecture is noticeable;
    </li>
    <li>
      an object is particularly nice;
    </li>
    <li>
      nature is amazing.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I also take picture of people, sometimes to remember them or remember an
    event, other times, because they are a living representation of a times
    and place, or because they may wear something I find unusually nice.
    However, I take seriously their privacy. Hence, I do not share these 
    pictures.
