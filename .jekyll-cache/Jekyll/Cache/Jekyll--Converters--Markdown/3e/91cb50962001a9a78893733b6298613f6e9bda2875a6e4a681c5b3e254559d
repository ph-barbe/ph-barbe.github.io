<p>In my spare time, I currently do few things: reading, writing, music, some wood working, and I can probably build a house from scratch though I never tried.</p>

<p>My non-professional interests have been changing over the years, depending to where I lived, who I hanged out with, and geo-political events. Some constant have been international, domestic and military affaires. I used to listen a lot of music and play a fair amount of piano. I learned the clarinett for a few years, and played the organ. I also wrote some music, stopped for several decades, and went back to it lately. I was at some point very knowledgeable in Soviet movies because ticket at the Soviet sponsored cinema in Paris were very cheap!</p>
