<p>As a business person, I do really one thing: innovation! If your problem can be solved with standard methods, I am happy to tell you how to do it, but do not ask me to spend a lot of time on it.</p>

<p>There two broad categories of innovations in which I specialize:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>help organizations to define their vision and strategy. As a mathematician, I approach these in a very analytical way, with a lot of rigor, using both inductive and deductive methods, and imagination when it comes to vision (yes, mathematicians, like other scientist have imagination, for it is needed to solve difficult problems).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>data science, analytics, machine learning, applied math, operation research, whatever math, particularly for very difficult problems that require highly customized solutions. My current technical stack is mostly around Python (including Pandas, Numpy, Scikitlearn and many many others), SQL and variant, and if I need to write a UI, HTML, CSS and Javascript. I use PySpark if I need to process large volumes.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
