I"»<p>To build this site, I used Jekyll. I could not find a theme that suited what I wanted to do, and ended up writing a lot more css than I anticipated!</p>

<p>Some of the fine points that were annoying:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>all the ligning up of boxes and text that make the page;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the detail on the navigation menu (the page you are on is marked darker, and color changes as you hover on the items);</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>when writing a list in markdown, markdownify seems to add some div or p in the html, which somehow messed up some of the css classes;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>originally, the text was in black, but a dark gray works better;</p>
  </li>
</ul>
