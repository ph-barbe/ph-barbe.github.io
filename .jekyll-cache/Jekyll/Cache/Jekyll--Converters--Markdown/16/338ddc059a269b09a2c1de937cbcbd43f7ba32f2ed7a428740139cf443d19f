<p>I have been a professional mathematician from 1994 to 2014, working at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, mostly traveling the world (I was invited professor at Yale, Georgia Tech and the like on the planet). I invented some new mathematics, including data science, wrote over 50 refereed papers, and 5 books. I am still doing some math when I have time. I also gave many talks, for audiences ranging from a few to over 1,000.</p>

<p>Originally, my expertise was in data science, but I ended up very knowledgeable in many other areas that most data scientists ignore though they are extremely useful in data science: harmonic analysis, group representation, differential geometry, algebraic topology, ODE and PDE, current probability theory, some algebraic geometry, and other areas.</p>

<p>I published papers in statistics, probability theory, combinatoris and q-algebraic equations, and some with a bend toward differential geometry and harmonic analysis.</p>

<p>I have been working in a few countries in Europe, North America and Asia. Traveling is important to me, not as a tourist, but to work and meet with people. Notably, I have been going to China since 1996.</p>

<p>I have been collaborating with economists, medical doctors, physicist, and biologists.</p>

<p>I was an economist at some point, and did some noted work on the cost of unemployment in France.</p>

<p>I am a decent programmer. Since 2014, I am mostly using the stack mentionned in “what I do”. I also use TeX to write math, and Postscript when I need to do some highly complex and accurate graphics. I used R between 2000 and 2014. In a far past, I knew SAS very well. Over the years I have learned (and forgoten) Basic, Pascal, Fortran, Lisp, Rexx, C, C++ and a few others.</p>
