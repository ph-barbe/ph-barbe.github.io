            <p>I am not a serious photographer. Since this is my personal website, this page is less about my pictures, than about why I am taking them and what interests me in photography.</p>

<p>I spent some time in the past working on
pictures with a non-digital camera and black and white films. 
When digital came, I had other priorities, and never bought a good
digital camera. When phones became good camera, my interest 
in photography came back, in a different way, and I can see myself 
getting more serious about it in the future. For now, all what I am using is my cell phone, mostly because I do not want to carry more equipment.</p>

<p>The following pictures have been sometimes cropped, but their colors are the original ones. As I indicated, they are intended not as a exhibition, but as a way to tell why I take pictures.</p>

<p>I take pictures for various reasons, but my pleasure of taking them derive from being able to see a richer world by focusing on some of its details. The poet Francis Ponge wrote <em>J’écris pour ajouter au monde quelque chose qui l’augmente</em> (I write to add to the world something that increases it). This is very much the way I feel about taking picture: it adds to the world that I perceive by forcing me to look at it differently.</p>

<p>While on the face of the picture, this addition may seem about what is pictured, it is sometimes about the people for whom I take these pictures.</p>

            <p>My friend Brian was born in the United States, knows his country very
well, is well traveled within, but never went outside. His curiosity
is boundless though. Because I
traveled and still travel a fair amount in Europe and Asia, he asked
me to show him what these places look like. I take picture of places
for him. I cannot remember how, but Carole joined Brian in asking
pictures. So I take pictures for Brian and Carole!</p>

So are self-driven metros and trains. The reason is that they have a dedicated infrastructure which reduces the variability of what the software needs to respond to. Parts of Hong Kong seem perfect to make self-driving cars a reality, because they would have a dedicated infrastructure.</td>

                Doors in Paris
        </button>
        <div class="content">
            
            <p>There are plenty of things to picture in Paris. But Brian and Carole has seen many street pictures over the years. I thought that I could give them a different feeling for the city by sending them pictures about a single topic, which would force me to look more closely to that topic and see the city differently. One such topic was doors and gates, which are under the same name <em>porte</em> in French.</p>

<p>It turns out that doors and gates are amazingly diverse in Paris. But picturing them created interesting questions on their purpose.</p>

<p>This large gate opens one of the university. It is a particularly long structure, that can go down and completely disapear. It has various doors in it, of various sizes. It is a serious barrier, in heavy steal, preventing to enter when needed, opening a wide and welcoming plazza when lowered. Its purpose is clear: prevent entrance. Yet, it fits the need of an academic institution to be open on the outside, for everyone to see inside.</p>

<p><img src="/photography/doors/IMG_E7301.JPG" alt="gate" class="img-responsive" width="100%" float="left" /></p>

<p>Overall, I found doors of unversities to be really interesting in revealing the ambivalence of the faculty toward restricting access.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>These doors are quite typical of many official buildings. They belong to a high school. The triptych allows for France’s motto ‘Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité’ (Liberty, Equality, Fraternity) to be placed at the top of each part, marking the official nature of the building. The triptych also marks the importance of those who enter. The usual entrance is by one of the small doors. If you go by the middle door with a single panel open, you are certainly a noticeable guest. And if both panels are open, then you must be an important person fulfilling an important mission. Doors mark not only the entrance but also the status of those who come in.</td>

<p>Craftsmen took great pride in embelishing doors. Some have a lot of meaning in their embelishments, such as that on the left which belongs to the Sainte Geneviève library: Sainte Geneviève is represented, as well as wreaths symbolizing knowledge</p>

<p>The doors here are a small sample of the many I pictured. I was surprised not only by their diversity, but also by how much there is to say on each of them, their form, function, location, symbolism…</p>

            <p>My friend Joseph who studied photography seriously told me that photography is about light.

            <p>Objects are all around us. Decorative arts are an endless source of wonder that brightens everyday life. I find very moving that humans have this desire for aesthetic in objects that we use every day. This aesthetic search makes every day objects exceptional, changing their function from being used every day to being used in special occasions. Beyond captureing their beauty, picturing them is a way to express my admiration for those who design them.</p>

<p>Some old objects show that this search for aesthetic is ingrained in us. It is also sometimes stunning how simple tools in the hand of trained craftsmen allow to create perfect objects, everywhere in the world.</p>

<p>Chairs may be the most difficult pieces to design, for they need to be comfortable and not create back problems. Some are designed for homes, and some are designed for public spaces; the difference may be only through the material used, but it can also be through the shape. The curved sofa is interesting because it starts with a simple yet clever pattern, and turns it to create a volume. I truely admire designers who come up with these clever ideas.</p>

<p>Some artists with amazing imagination create new objects, not painting, not sculpture, hard to define, but so beautiful, transforming what would be an ordinary place into an exhibition gallery, able to use the most modern and unatural materials to allude to the most ancient and natural themes.</p>

            <p>In its ownm way, mathematics is a study of a conceptual formulations of nature. Mathematical objects are every day objects, abstracted.</p>

<p>Partial differential equations govern fluid dynamics, modeling the patterns seen in these two pictures.</p>

<p>Elementary and differential geometries model light patterns.</p>

<p>When winter combines fluid dynamics and geometry, interesting textures result!</p>

<p>Plant growth is a complicated matter. Some differential equations model growth, some stochastic processes model cracking.</p>

<p>Some models of growth may be used to describe moss, random fields may model complex terrains.</p>

<p>Tesselations appear naturally, and various models exists, using partial differential equations, stochastic aggregations and other mathematical objects. Add a simple stone to it, and the physical wonder takes an aesthetic quality. Asking why this stone is there amounts to a vast questionning of the world around us, a perception of its complex beauty, a search for purpose.</p>

<p>Erosion deposit processes have also been modeled.</p>

<p>But nature keeps us wondering…</p>

<p>And when humans give their view of nature, they may take an every day cardbox and create a mysterious forest… making us rethinking what is a real forest.</p>

            <p>I like to experiment with things, and repurpose them.</p>

<p>The camera on my phone has a landscape function. The software tracks components of the image and glue them together as one rotates the camera. This allows for 360 degree (or less) pictures.</p>

<p>But that can be repurposed… tricked to track the wrong thing and distort reality.  If you fight against the software by moving the camera in a way that the sky is seemingly the only thing that can be tracked, then your world collapses with that of the software designer, creating a collision of two planets! What does it say on us that we still recognize the blue of the sky?</p>
