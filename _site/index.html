        <h3 id="professional-interests-and-background">Professional interests and background</h3>

<p>My professional interests are in business and mathematics, including data science. Currently, I am mostly doing consulting work.</p>

<p>I have a PhD in mathematics from Université Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris 6), a master in Statistics from Université Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris 6), and a degree in economics and government from the École Nationale de la Statistique et de l’Administration Économique in Paris.</p>

        <h3 id="what-i-do">What I do</h3>

<p>As a business person, I do really one thing: innovation.</p>

<p>If your problem can be solved with standard methods, I am happy to tell you how to do it, but do not ask me to spend a lot of time on it. I am always seeking difficult problems.</p>

<p>There two broad categories of innovations in which I specialize:</p>

<p>1. help organizations to define their vision and strategy. As a mathematician, I approach these in a very analytical way, with a lot of rigor, using both inductive and deductive methods, and imagination when it comes to vision (yes, mathematicians, like other scientists have imagination, for it is needed to solve difficult problems).</p>

<p>2. data science, analytics, machine learning, applied math, operation research, whatever math, particularly for very difficult problems that require highly customized solutions.</p>

<p>My original training was in economics and government affairs. I was more an economist or econometrician, and did some noted work on the cost of unemployment in France.</p>

<p>I have been a professional mathematician from 1994 to 2014, working at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), mostly traveling the world (I was invited professor at Yale, Georgia Tech and the like on the planet). I invented some new mathematics, including data science, wrote over 50 refereed papers, and 5 books. I am still doing some math when I have time. I also gave many talks, for audiences ranging from a few to over 1,000.</p>

<p>Since 2014, I have been working in the US, in consulting (health care and IoT) and media.</p>

<p>Originally, my expertise as mathematician was in data science, but I ended up very knowledgeable in many other areas that most data scientists ignore though they are extremely useful in data science: harmonic analysis, group representation, differential geometry, algebraic topology, ODE and PDE, current probability theory, some algebraic geometry, and other areas. My personal mathematics library has about 2,000 volumes – I read and own more regular books too!</p>

<p>My published papers are in data science, probability theory, combinatorics and q-algebraic equations, and some with a bend toward differential geometry, harmonic analysis, and algebra.</p>

<p>I have been collaborating with other mathematicians, statisticians, economists, medical doctors, physicists, and biologists. This gave me the opportunity to work with people on and from different continent, different language, different culture both in terms of the country they come from and their professional interests.</p>

<p>Traveling to work and meet with people is an important part of my life. Changing scenery is good to look at problems from a different perspective. I have been working in a few countries in Europe, North America and Asia. Notably, I have been going to China since 1996. I seldom travel to the sole purpose of tourism, but if I am somewhere, I certainly go to see museums, significant places, and the surroundings.</p>

<p>Since 2014, my technical stack for computing is mostly around Python (including Pandas, Numpy, Scikitlearn and many many others), SQL and variants, and if I need to write a UI, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP or Python. I use PySpark if I need to process large volumes.</p>

<p>I also use TeX to write math, and Postscript when I need to do some highly complex and accurate graphics.</p>

<p>I used R between 2000 and 2014. In a far past, I knew SAS very well. Over the years I have learned (and forgoten) Basic, Pascal, Fortran, Lisp, Rexx, C, C++ and a few others.</p>

<p>I setup this website with Jekyll. I could not find a theme I liked and ended up writing more html and css than I anticipated.</p>

        <h3 id="personal-interests">Personal interests</h3>

<p>In my spare time, I currently do a few things: reading, writing, music, some wood working, and I can probably build a house from scratch though I never tried. I also had periods of elaborate cooking, though now I am mostly baking my own bread every day – French baguettes straight from the oven are irresistible! I owe this bread making interest to our friend Joseph who is an accomplished musician, baker, writer, and photographer.</p>

<p>Throughout my life I have been practicing sports, but I am not looking as superman. I have no interest in watching sports. I went to a school where 6 hours of sport each week was mandatory (3 times 2 hours). It also required students to learn a new sport every semester, under the direction of particularly knowledgeable teachers. I have practiced various ball sports (soccer, rubgy, handball, basketball, water polo, tennis, babmington), running (100m, 500m, relay, hurdling, long distance), throwing (hammer, javelin, disk, weight), jumping (high jump, long jump, pole vault), swiming (crawl, butterfly, breaststroke, diving), gymanstic (horizontal bar, parallel bar, rings, rope climbing). I was a avid fencer (all weapons) for several years. I got from this tremendous training an appreciation for all of these sports, a clear understanding that I was really poor at some and quite good at others, and tons of fun memory! I still do some physical activity to keep in shape, but nothing exotic.</p>

<p>If you want to laugh at my expenses: I jumped far lower at the pole vault then at the high jump! The only way I can jump as high is to throw away the pole before jumping!</p>

<p>My non-professional interests have been changing over the years, depending to where I lived, who I hanged out with, and geo-political events. Some constants have been international, domestic and military affaires. I used to listen a lot of music and play a fair amount of piano. I learned the clarinet for a few years, and played the organ. I also wrote some music, stopped for several decades, and went back to it in 2020. I was at some point very knowledgeable in Soviet movies because tickets at the Soviet sponsored cinema in Paris were very cheap!</p>

<p>I also read a fair amount on the following topics: architecture and design (though I am not good at drawing), and sustainability.</p>
