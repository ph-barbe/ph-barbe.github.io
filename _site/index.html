            <p>My professional interests are in business and mathematics, including data science. Currently, I am mostly doing consulting work.</p>

<p>I have a PhD in mathematics and a master in statistics from Université Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris 6), and a degree in economics and government from the École Nationale de la Statistique et de l’Administration Économique (ENSAE) in Paris.</p>

                <p>As a business person, I do really one thing: innovation. There two broad categories of innovations in which I specialize:</p>

<!--more-->
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>help organizations to define their vision and strategy. As a mathematician, I approach these in a very analytical way, with a lot of rigor, using both inductive and deductive methods, and imagination when it comes to vision (yes, mathematicians, like other scientists have imagination, for it is needed to solve difficult problems).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>data science, analytic, machine learning, applied math, operation research, whatever math, particularly for very difficult problems that require highly customized solutions. As a loose indication, the problems I tackle range from organizing work and leading teams, to designing complex decision supporting systems, to designing new algorithms, to inventing new conceptual frameworks for solving your problem.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If your problem can be solved with standard methods, I am happy to tell you how to do it, but do not ask me to spend a lot of time on it. I am always seeking difficult problems.</p>

                <p>My original training was in economics and government affairs. I was more an economist or econometrician, and did some noted work on the cost of unemployment in France.</p>

<p>I have been a professional mathematician from 1994 to 2014, working at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), mostly traveling the world (I was invited professor at Yale, Georgia Tech and the like on the planet). I invented some new mathematics, including data science, wrote over 50 refereed papers, and 5 books. I am still doing some math when I have time. I also gave many talks, for audiences ranging from a few to over 1,000.</p>

<p>Since 2014, I have been working in the US, in consulting (health care and IoT) and media.</p>

<p>Originally, my expertise as mathematician was in data science, but I ended up very knowledgeable in many other areas that most data scientists ignore though they are extremely useful in data science: harmonic analysis, group representation, differential geometry, algebraic topology, ODE and PDE, current probability theory, some algebraic geometry, and other areas. My personal mathematics library has about 2,000 volumes – I read and own more regular books too!</p>

<p>My published papers are in data science, probability theory, combinatorics, q-algebraic geometry, some with a bend toward differential geometry, harmonic analysis, and algebra.</p>

<p>I have been collaborating with other mathematicians, statisticians, economists, medical doctors, physicists, engineers, and biologists. This gave me the opportunity to work with people on and from different continents, different languages, different cultures both in terms of the country they come from and their professional interests.</p>

<p>Traveling to work and meet with people is an important part of my life. Changing scenery is good to look at problems from a different perspective. I have been working in a few countries in Europe, North America and Asia. Notably, I have been going to China since 1996. I seldom travel to the sole purpose of tourism, but if I am somewhere, I certainly go to see museums, significant places, and the surroundings.</p>

<p>Since 2014, my technical stack for computing is mostly around Python (including Pandas, Numpy, Scikitlearn and many many others), SQL and variants, and if I need to write a UI, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP or Python. I use PySpark if I need to process large volumes.</p>

<p>I also use TeX to write math, and Postscript when I need to do some highly complex and accurate graphics.</p>

<p>I used R between 2000 and 2014. In a far past, I knew SAS very well. Over the years I have learned (and forgotten) Basic, Pascal, Fortran, Lisp, Rexx, C, C++ and a few others.</p>

<p>I setup this website with Jekyll. I could not find a theme I liked and ended up writing more html and css than I anticipated.</p>

            <div class="content">
                
                <p>My avatar is a collage of book covers which tells you a fair amount on myself.</p>

<p>The books are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Strategor</em>: probably the best book ever written on strategy for business persons. It covers business strategy, corporate strategy, and change management. It is in French and is the standard textbook in top MBA programs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>The Elements of Statistical Learning</em> by J. Friedman, R. Tibshirani, and T. Hastie. This illustrates my original training as well as the change of semantic that I have witnessed. The content of the book used to be part of standard statistics, and got rebranded as machine learning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Shape and Shape Theory</em> by D. G. Kendall, D. Barden, T. K. Carne, H. Le. Shape theory is one of these fields that any data scientist dealing with image should know, and most ignore. It illustrates my interest in geometric matter, and how I like data science: when it intersects many fields, as here, statistics, differenial geometry, algebraic topology, and computing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Probabilité</em> by myself and M. Ledoux. Writing is an important part of my life, in particular writing books, and so is teaching. Michel Ledoux has influenced many French probabilists. Among many things, he taught me to strive for simplicity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Three Dimensional Geometry and Topology</em> by W. Thurston. Not only the topic is interesting, but it is the most beautifully typset mathematical book I know. This represents my interests in pure mathematics, as well as the years I studied typography and book composition. It is also attached to David Pollard who made me interested in typesetting and typography, as well as some wonderful time in Blacksburg with Bill Floyd who was involved in the making of this book; and by association, his colleagues in the math department, Marty Day, Peter Haskell, Leslie Kay, John Rossi and others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Deep Learning</em> by I. Goodfellow, Y. Bengio, A. Courville, is in the same spirit as Friedman, Tibshirani and Hastie’s book. It is also my marketing side: I wanted something about the topic of deep learning, and this is one of the few books available on the topic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Commentaire</em> is a journal founded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Aron">Raymond Aron</a>. The journal is very much a miror of his founder, dominated by realism and pragmatism, with a bend toward liberalism and social democracy. The authors tend to be practionners more than academics. It reflects my interest in the broad range of topics that it covers, albeit from a French perspective.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Political Science Quarterly</em> is about political science, but more broadly, discusses domestic and international affairs, somewhat like <em>Commentaire</em>, but more from an american perspective. It is more scholarly than <em>Commentaire</em> and this reflects my taste for in depth analyses, as well as my American side.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beethoven’s sonata because classical music is an important part of my life, both as a listener and as a (very amateur) musician who plays the piano.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This makes it a decent overview of who I am, and tells you more about myself than a picture.</p>

            <div class="content">
                
                <p>In my spare time, I currently do a few things: reading, writing, music, some wood working, and I can probably build a house from scratch though I never tried. I also had periods of elaborate cooking, though now I am mostly baking my own bread every day – French baguettes straight from the oven are irresistible! I owe this bread making interest to our friend Joseph who is an accomplished musician, baker, writer, and photographer.</p>

<p>Throughout my life I have been practicing sports, but I am not looking as superman. I have no interest in watching sports. I went to a school where 6 hours of sport each week was mandatory (3 times 2 hours). It also required students to learn a new sport every semester, under the direction of particularly knowledgeable teachers. I have practiced various ball sports (soccer, rubgy, handball, basketball, water polo, tennis, babmington), running (100m, 500m, relay, hurdling, long distance), throwing (hammer, javelin, disk, weight), jumping (high jump, long jump, pole vault), swiming (crawl, butterfly, breaststroke, diving), gymanstic (horizontal bar, parallel bar, rings, rope climbing). I was a avid fencer (all weapons) for several years. I got from this tremendous training an appreciation for all of these sports, a clear understanding that I was really poor at some and quite good at others, and tons of fun memory! I still do some physical activity to keep in shape, but nothing exotic.</p>

<p>If you want to laugh at my expense: I jumped far lower at the pole vault then at the high jump! The only way I can jump as high is to throw away the pole before jumping!</p>

<p>My non-professional interests have been changing over the years, depending to where I lived, who I hanged out with, and geo-political events. Some constants have been international, domestic and military affaires. I used to listen a lot of music and play a fair amount of piano. I learned the clarinet for a few years, and played the organ. I also wrote some music, stopped for several decades, and went back to it in 2020. I was at some point very knowledgeable in Soviet movies because tickets at the Soviet sponsored cinema in Paris were very cheap!</p>

<p>I also read a fair amount on the following topics: architecture and design (though I am not good at drawing), and sustainability.</p>
