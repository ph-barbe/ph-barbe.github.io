    Music is a life long interest. I have been serious about it at 
    various points in my life, in various forms. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I play the piano, though
    much less than before. I played the clarinet and the organ. I wrote a lot
    music decades ago. Music technology was reserved for professionals then. However,
    I had the great luck to meet the wonderful composer, architect and engineer 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iannis_Xenakis">Iannis Xenakis</a>
    and write for his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UPIC">UPIC</a>.
    Otherwse, music paper was the 
    only option to write music, and it was still fairly expensive.
  </p>
  <p>
    Years later, in 2020, as I had to travel during the covid-19 pandemic, I
    had to quarantine a couple of times. I was seeking for something unusual to
    do while locked in a bedroom. I was told about 
    <a href="https://musescore.org/en">Musescore</a> and thought it would be 
    interesting to try writing some music with it.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am realistic on my composition skills! I am doing it for my own 
    amusement, not as a serious composer.
  </p>
  <p>
    I found composing with
    a computer a different experience than with paper. On a laptop it is 
    impossible to have an overall view of the score. Sketching a small bit
    is also more clunky than writing it quickly on a piece of paper, 
    particularly since I was learning the software, and using
    a laptop with its small unique screen. But there are things that
    are deceptively simple, like copying a pattern and transposing.
  </p>
  <p>
    The rendering of the music through the software is quite
    good for binary rythms. For more other ryhtms it can be really bad. 
    One problem is that it does not interpret, placing accents on the beats,
    adding dynamic. There are trick to fix these problems, but they are time
    consuming to implements, it was more than I wanted to do. As a consequence,
    the piece Quarantine 2 is rendered very poorly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Added to the rendering problem, I also like the baroque tradition of
    leaving a lot of freedom to the player, and therefore not marking
    too much the score. Afterall, if anyone wants to play these pieces
    with even other instruments, they are very welcome to do so!
