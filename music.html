    Music is a life long interest. I have been serious about it at 
    various points in my life, in various forms. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I play the piano, though
    much less than before. I played the clarinet, the organ, and wrote a lot
    of music decades ago. 
    Music technology was reserved for professionals then. However,
    I had the great luck to meet the wonderful composer, architect and engineer 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iannis_Xenakis">Iannis Xenakis</a>
    and write for his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UPIC">UPIC</a>.
    Otherwse, music paper was the 
    only option to write music, and it was still fairly expensive.
  </p>
  <p>
    Years later, in 2020, as I had to travel during the covid-19 pandemic, and
    had to quarantine a couple of times. I was seeking to do something unusual
    while locked in a bedroom. I was told about 
    <a href="https://musescore.org/en">MuseScore</a> and thought it would be 
    interesting to try writing some music with it.
  </p>
  <p>
    I found composing with
    a computer a very different experience than with paper, and I
    ended up writing very different music. On a laptop it is 
    impossible to have an overall view of the score. Sketching a small bit
    is also more clunky than writing it quickly on a piece of paper, 
    particularly since I was learning the software and using
    a laptop with its small unique screen. But there are things that
    are deceptively simple, like copying a pattern and transposing.
  </p>
  <p>
    I like the baroque tradition of
    leaving a lot of freedom to the player, and therefore not marking
    too much the score. Afterall, if anyone wants to play these pieces
    with even other instruments, they are very welcome to do so. As the
    pianist Alexandre Tharaud wrote in the introduction to his recording
    of Bach transcriptions, in that time, copyright did not exist, and 
    transcribing a piece from a composer for other instrument was a way
    to honor that composer. The drawback is that the software does not render
    the piece very well, and sometimes really badly!
  </p>
  <p>
    I am realistic on my composition skills! I am doing it for my own 
    amusement, not as a serious composer. But this gives you a glimpse
    of my psyche when I am quarantined.
